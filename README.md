# PyCraft
Minecraft clone written in Python.

This game is my attempt to clone Minecraft in Python. It does have some bugs in
it, but it is fairly bug-free, the main bug being an issue with Pyglet that
causes the exclusive mouse not to work correctly.

This is a heavily modified version of Fogleman's Minecraft:
https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft

Controls:
WASD to move, 
Space to jump, 
1 to cycle block, 
Leftclick to destroy block, Rightclick to place block, 
T to open command console, 
Tab to toggle flight, 
Escape to free the mouse, click window to lock it again, 
V to save world.
